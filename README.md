# CHALLENGUE 9 [SQL]


It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

The CSV that you will be using are located on the resources folder, make sure to point them correctly when you create and import them to the tables

The sketch of the Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables was created on QUICKDBD: https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/

This is the sketch that served as a guidance for the link between tables:

The Primary Keys and Foreign keys were selected in order to link all tables without problems.
